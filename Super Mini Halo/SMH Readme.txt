 Edits:
========

   All graphics can be edited so you can change your character or even the background. Here is a list of all the things that can be safely edited.

  Icon0 - The origanal and Xmas version is provided but feel free to change the Icon as long as the Title stays the same and the letters SMH appear on the Icon.
  smh_bkg - This file is the background picture and can be edited. The file must be a 24 bit bmp with the dementions 512x256 pixels
  smh_gfx - This is the GFX Card and can be edited to your likeing...
  smh_mus.mod - The background music can be edited freely, Very hard to do for beginers.

NOTE: If you want to use anything from the Xmas version of the game you must rename them for this version. That means change mch to smh on all the files.
